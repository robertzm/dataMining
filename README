To execute this program, you’d better import this project into IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.5 (or Eclipse, 
but I didn't test it) and use JDK 1.8.0_60. Besides, there is an external .jar library, 
jcommander-1.27.jar, which is used to handle multiple parameters. Please include it as your 
external library.

Prameters are defined as follows:

@Parameter(names = {"-i", "-indir"}, description = "Input file directory")
public String inDir;
@Parameter(names = {"-o", "-outdir"}, description = "Output file directory")
public String outDir;
@Parameter(names = {"-d", "-delimiter"}, description = "Delimiter symbol in input file")
public String deli;
@Parameter(names = {"-k"}, description = "The clusters number")
public int clusterNum = 3;
@Parameter(names = {"-sr"}, description = "The clusters number range start point")
public int startRange = 3;
@Parameter(names = {"-er"}, description = "The clusters number range end point")
public int endRange = 3;
@Parameter(names = {"-iter"}, description = "The iteration for each clusters number")
public int iter = 100;
@Parameter(names = {"-m"}, description = "The maximum iteration to find centroid")
public int maxIter = 100;
@Parameter(names = {"-n"}, description = "Normalization or not, 0: non-normalization, 1: normalization")
public int norm = 0;

Test dataset are all stored in ./proj/dat directory.
Test output are all stored in ./proj directory.
Scource code are all stored in ./src directory.

Usage:
Set parameters like
-i dat/baskball.arff –o output.txt –sr 2 –er 20 –iter 100 –n 0
    
Recompile, run and wait for result. 
Happy done.
